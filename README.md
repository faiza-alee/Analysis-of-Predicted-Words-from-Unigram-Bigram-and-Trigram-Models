- Unigram Model: Provides predictions without any context, leading to generalized results that are often irrelevant to the sequence.
- Bigram Model: Adds minimal context by considering the last word, yielding moderate relevance but limited adaptability to longer sequences.
- Trigram Model: Offers the most accurate and contextually appropriate predictions by leveraging the previous two words, though it still falls back to simpler models if specific trigrams are missing.
In conclusion, while the trigram model generally offers the best predictive quality among the three, its effectiveness depends on the corpus size and diversity. For applications requiring high accuracy in next-word predictions, higher-order models such as trigrams are preferable, assuming a comprehensive corpus is available.
